# Git Course

## Day 1



### Fist part: Git

Git is a distributed version control system. It is a program that can be installed in our computer

What does version mean? Not only the version of the program but of the whole project/folder with other folders and files. 

 - We can assign a version to changes in the file
 - powerfull to collaborate with other people
 - manage changes to source code over time

We can use git in our own computer by it's own that is what we will be doming next

But since it was thought as a collaborative project, it is usefull to share the changes we have made in our computer with others - for that we can use Github
